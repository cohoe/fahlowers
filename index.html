Here you can see statistics on who has been following you on Twitter. </p><h2>First Time</h2>If this is your first time on this app, you won't see very much other than your current followers (available via the Current Followers link above). Beware that the Twitter API limits the number of times you can use this per 15 minutes. Clicking on it will show you a list of your current followers and stash this list for the next time you come back. You can see all stashed lists in the Follower History are. <h2>Seeing Changes</h2>After a few days have gone by and you've saved a few lists (done by simply navigating to the Current Followers page) you can click Changes above and compare two different lists. You will be shown the difference between them (who has started and who has stopped following you).<h2>Privacy</h2>I cannot see anything in your account beyond it's public profile. I don't store anything more than a bunch of Twitter ID Numbers and timestamps. This project is 100% open source so you can see exactly what code is running (see Github link below).<h2>Why this exists</h2>I was tired of seeing advertisement tweets from fllwrs.com in my feed, so I wrote this to do the same thing without ads. Also because I wanted to write a Twitter app. And because I had nothing better to do. Got feature requests or feedback? Shoot me an email!
